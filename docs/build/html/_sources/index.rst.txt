Welcome to SkillNer's documentation!
====================================

SkillNer is an NLP package that leverage **Named Entity Recognition** (NER) to automatically extract 
skills and certifications from job postings and applicants' resumes.


At the core, SkillNer is a skill extractor. Yet, it unlocks tons of features, 
e.g. helps both recruiters to find the best matches for their needs and applicants learn more about the job market.

Team
----
We started small with a team of two members, `Anas AIT AOMAR`_ and `Badr MOUFAD`_ . 
Yet, with **SkillNer** being open
sourced, the team will surely get bigger and bigger.
